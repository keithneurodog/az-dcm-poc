VS2 - Collectoid - UX Workshop

Hi all,

I'm working on the UX for Collectoid and I'd like to try to obtain some impatial requirements, via a workshop, to understand scope and complexity.

I'll walk you though a very early UI mockup to fuel discussion on the use of agentic tooling and discuss ux-first approach for requirements gathering.

I'd also like to focus on a couple of key areas where I hope we can have a quick demo/talk and then further discussion.

(1) Data collection Management - understand the latest (high level) end-to-end process and understand the expected user roles and responsibilities
(2) Immuta - see how their PBAC will integrate in a streamlined approach that puts the 90/10 initiative first

I really would like all stakeholders in this, and finding the right calendar spot is a challenge, please if you can't make it then suggest a more appropriate time.

I will of course record for those who cannot find any time to spare at this hectic time of year.

Thanks,
Keith
