[VS2-334] Consumption environments

Background:
TBC

User Story:
As a Data Owner/Delegate Data Owner, I want to specify target analysis environments so that provisioning scope and boundaries are clearly defined.

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN an Open Access Collection WHEN recording where User will access the data THEN target analysis environment selection is enabled.
GIVEN a default provisioning boundary defined by Leadership WHEN a data collection is set THEN the default boundaries are applied (e.g., "Provision to Domino only").
GIVEN a default provisioning boundary defined by Leadership WHEN a data collection analysis is needed in additional or other environments THEN additional ones are available for selection.
