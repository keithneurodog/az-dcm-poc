# NEW FLOW 2.0!
- check out Marcin's documentation (bic tool flows and JIRA) to determine this new flow
- allow a user to get an agreement in principle - define their new collection idea and it's data (possibly in 1 step)
- allow another user to come and sign off this AiP
- more steps... possibly more users e.g. TALT signoff / DPO or data owners e.g. domino platform owners signoff

## end useer flow
- end screen / request screen should be helpful more - suggest how to access open data e.g. this data is open now via domino, click here to access...
